            <br ><br ><h2>Preamble</h2>
            <br >Article 12 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (DSGVO for short) requires that I explain to you "in a precise, transparent, understandable and easily accessible form [and] in clear and simple language" what is happening here on this website.

            <h2>2. SSL or TLS encryption</h2>
            <br >For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content that you send to me as the site operator, our website uses SSL or TLS encryption. This means that data you transmit via this website cannot be read by third parties. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the "https://" address line of your browser and the lock symbol in the browser line.
            <br ><br ><br >
            
            <h2>3. Contact</h2>
            <br >If you send me an e-mail, you have to live with the fact that I receive data from you. I will then see your e-mail address, possibly also your IP address and if I make a real effort and manually evaluate the X header of your e-mail, I may even be able to see the name of the computer from which you wrote the message. This is not magic or hacker art, but an Internet standard. Anyone who can read it can access this data. This is technical - and has been the case for many years. If you send me your data without being asked, you may assume that I will protect your e-mail just as well or badly as all my other e-mails. If you should ever think that I should delete the e-mail you sent me without being asked, you may politely ask me to do so - but I won't promise anything. Again, if you can't live with that, please don't send me an email.
